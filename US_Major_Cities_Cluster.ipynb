    "# PROBLEM STATEMENT AND BACKGROUND:\n",
    "Data Cafe is having extreme success in their new location in downtown Chicago. Data Cafe has also concluded that its brand and customer outreach has grown signficantly by simply being in a major city's high traffic area. To keep this growth momentum going, Data Cafe is looking to open a new coffee shop in another major US city. The question is where? \n",
    "\n",
    "Data Cafe's CEO has asked WildDataBeast to help with a comprehensive analysis on each major city's center, including a short comnpare and contrast on the market between the top ten major cities including Chicago. \n",

    "\n",
    "# DESCRIPTION OF DATA AND PROBLEM SOLVING METHOD:\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to complete this task, WildDataBeast has decided to:\n",
    "1. Web scrape a dataframe of major US cities found on Wikipedia\n",
    "2. Clean and format data\n",
    "3. Lock in on major cities in the US (the top 10) .\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Chicago - Congress Plaza Hotel, Data Cafe\n",
    "    2. New York - City Hall\n",
    "    3. Houston - One Shell Plaza\n",

    "4. Obtain latitude and longitude coordinates for each city and map them\n",
    "5. Use Foursquare API to pull 100 venues from each city center's radius\n",
    "6. Format each venue into binary data grouped by city (have or dont have)\n",
    "7. Normalize the binary venue data into means for comparison\n",
    "8. Use kmeans from sklearn library to cluster each city using the normalized binary data.\n",
    "9. Visualize the data by:  \n",
    "    1. Dataframes per cluster assigned (see similar cities by venue)\n",
    "    2. Dataframe with top 10 venue category per city (see venue types)\n",

    "# BUSINESS PROBLEM AND AUDIENCE:\n",
    "The business problem is that business growth is needed if Data Cafe wants to outsurvive in the ever innovating coffee shop industry. It is especially important for a coffee shop to make a name for itself and become known as a household name in order to compete with other well known establishments. \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefor, location is king in the coffee shop industry and there is no better locations than bussling areas full of corporate workers and college students in a major US city center. \n",
    "\n",
    "This exploratory analysis on market venues of each major US city is vital information for any CEO with a vision to grow, and grow fast. It is even more important to understand what is the compitition in a particular area, if there are any complimentery businesses in an area, or if there is a specific footprint dying for a coffee shop to be opened within a short walk. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# ABOUT THE DATA USED:\n",
    "The data used to identify the largest major cities in the US by population came from infoplease.com (see source link below). Here the 2010 Census was used, assuming that these major US cities have sustained their postition, at the very least the top 10 cities other than Chicago. \n",
    "\n",
    "The data used to identify venues within each city's center was pulled using the Foursquare API. A limit of 100 venues per city was used. The radius was increased to maximize the limit of venues per city center in order to capture as many nearby venues per city center as allowed. \n",
    "\n",
    "Major US Cities by Population Source:\n",
    "https://www.infoplease.com/us/us-cities/top-50-cities-us-population-and-rank\n",
    "\n",
    "Venue Information Source:\n",
    "https://foursquare.com/\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# METHODOLOGY:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Mapping the Selected Major Cities. \n",
    "First order of business after web scraping the required data needed, I used the folium library to map out the location of the top 10 major cities in the US, including Chicago. The mapping center is the center provided by geocoder by simply using X, USA where X is the name of the city. By mapping the coordinates used for each city, I was able to verify that these coordinates are correct and about where each major city's downtown area is located. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Use FourSquare API to Obtain Venues in each Major City \n",
    "I then used a Foursquare API to pull exactly 100 venues within a specified radius from each major city's downtown coordinates. I increased the size of the radius of each city's downtown coordinates (kept same size radius per city) until each city hit the limit of 100 venues per city. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Unsupervised Machine Learning: K-Means Clustering \n",
    "I used kmeans clusteirng from sklearn library to cluster each city based on venue categories. This meant Data Cafe fell within the Coffee Shop venue category. Since there are 10 cities with 100 venues each, this meant there was 1000 venues to categorize and format into a dataframe that could group each venue by city and display each venue category as a binary value, have or dont have this venue category per city. The purpose of this was not only to normalize the binary data by means, but to use this data for clustering. By clustering each major city with a label, we are able to see what major cities have in common or don't have in common with each other. This exersice would should if there are any oppurtunities that would drive the same success that Data Cafe has had in Chicago in another similar city. With labels obtained, I was then able color code each major city on a map. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Visualize the Data in Various Ways: \n",
    "To further explore findings beyond clustering labels, I decided to create a dataframe that displays the top 10 venue categories per city. This would help in comparing what similarities does each city have when it comes to the many other venue categories such as pizza places, parks, restuarants, and many other types of businesses. This would also aid in understanding what the market looks for in each area and understanding if there are any gaps that Data Cafe can exploit. \n",
    "\n",
    "To understand how much of each venue category there is per city center, I created an array to display the top 20 venue categories by sum of each venue. This would aid in understanding how much of each venue exist per city. Then understand if there is a coorelation between venue types. I found that there is a mean of 5 coffee shops in proximity to each major city's center (range of 3 to 11, Phoenix with the most), not including San Antonio, which only had 1 coffee shop (and found to be a little crazy, 14 hotels around its city hall).\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# RESULTS:\n",
    "\n",
    "By using K-means clustering, \n",
    "\n",
    "By using the Venue Count Dataframe created, I found that the top 10 major cities have anywhere between 1 to 11 coffee shops near its city center. This finding resulted in a mean of 5 coffee shops for the top ten major cities, not including San Antonio, which only had one near by coffee shop, despite ranking number 7 by population. San Antonio seems to be an outlier when it comes to coffee shop venues located near its city hall. What also stood out by San Antonio is that Hotels, American Restaurants, Museums, Plazas, and theaters ranked as the top 5 venues near its city hall.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**SAN ANTONIO'S TOP VENUES AND COUNT**\n",
    "1. Hotel- 14\n",

    "4. San Antonio with 1 (ranking at number 31)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION:\n",
    "\n",
    "After further analysis I found that the data does not indicate conclude the total population count of coffee shop venues in a city, but it does show that within a specific radius indicated that there is a certain number of coffee shops. Since there is a limit of 100 venues per city, it may be that the indicated area for each city may be saturated with other venues that coffee shops do not appear as frequently. Examples would be Chicago, there is a heavier density of various venues with the specified area that coffee shops may not even rank high in comparison to other venue categories. What it does indicate is that in location such as San Antonio (with 1 coffee shop in proximity) and Phoenix (with 11 coffee shops) do deserve more investigation into the market. Why is it that there is only 1 coffee shop near the City Hall of San Antonio, but 14 hotels? Why is it that Phoenix's City Hall has 11 coffee shops, 7 art galleries, and 6 pizza places as some of the most frequent venues closest to its City Hall? These may be worthy questions to explore further and understand what is different.   \n",
    "\n",
    "To diver deeper into San Antonio:\n",
    "\n",
    "Singling out San Antonio as an outlier in coffee shop frequency within proximity of its city hall, I did further investigation. Assuming that Foursquare data prvided is accurate and up-to-date, I found that the closest coffee shop to City Hall of San Antonio is a half a mile away which is a Starbucks. After finding this information a bit unbelievable, I did a simple google search on \"coffee shops near City Hall of San Antonio\" and found that there is a 7-Eleven which is more of convenience store, but nonetheless a source for anyone looking for a cup of coffee. Though the coffee from 7-Eleven may not be the quality most coffee enthusiast would seek. Based off this information, Data Cafe should further explore an oppurtunity in San Antonio, and better understand why other US major cities have Coffee Shops in their top 5 venues while San Antonio does not. \n",
    "\n",
    "These finding conclude that the CEO of Data Cafe should seek further market analysis in San Antonio for company growth oppurtunities. \n",
